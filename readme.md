# MotorwayTest

## Development

Libraries used
- Express
- TypeOrm
- Jest - For testing purpose

### Start development environment

-   Create `.env` file or run `cp sample.env .env`

You can look for the example in the `sample.env`

Next up you can choose to run your development environment entirely inside Docker or to run the app server directly on your local machine.

#### Running Postgres inside Docker

-   Start the development cluster

```bash

docker-compose up 

```


#### Running app server directly on your local machine's environment

- Run `npm i` or `npm install` to install all app dependencies
- Start the app at the root directory using
  - `npm run start:dev` for development
  - `npm run start` for production

# Todo

I had a lot of fun building this but there are some improvements I can still make:

- Add migrations for database purpose
- Add an application Monitoring tool like sentry
- Add more test cases
- add open Api for proper documentation
- Have a standard response helper

# Testing

- To run the tests, simply type `npm test`
- We can also get code coverage by `npm run coverage`

Thank you üëç
